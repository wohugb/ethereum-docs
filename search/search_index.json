Ethereum has been described in several ways, such as (the first and third resources are more general introductions, while the second is a technical introduction, although all are outdated.\nAnother introduction is available \nhere\n, but again, it is outdated. Despite being outdated, Ethereum has maintained backwards compatibility thus far up till January 1 2018, so the info is still relevant.):\n\n\n    \n\"A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform\"\u2014Ethereum White Paper\n\n    \n\"A secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger\" and a generalised \"transactional singleton machine with shared-state\". Also described as crypto-law\u2014Ethereum Yellow Paper\n\n    \nan open source \"programmable blockchain\"\u2014Ethdocs\n\n\n\nLet's briefly breakdown what those terms mean.\n\n\nDecentralized\n technology uses \npeer-to-peer computer networks\n (there's a picture below), and are not subject to the whims of a central authority such as a government or server administrator (like Google or Facebook) which can help to achieve better decision making for public good. \nBlockchain\n means that the currency is built and secured by adding and verifying blocks of transactions to blocks made previously, thus forming a \"chain\". Blocks added to the chain become harder and harder to crack over time, as they are verified by more nodes in the blockchain peer-to-peer network. Blockchain technology has been referred to as the \nWeb 3.0\n. The world wide web (retroactively the Web 1.0) consisted of websites publishing content and users passively reading/viewing it. The Web 2.0 used user interaction, such as forums (with upvoting and commenting), reaction buttons (e.g. the Facebook reactions: likes \ud83d\udc4d, love\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u00a0, laughter\u00a0\ud83d\ude06, wow\u00a0\ud83d\ude32, sad\u00a0\ud83d\ude22, angry\u00a0\ud83d\ude20), sharing (republishing), however these interactions have no direct economic effect on the host website; users do not share in the value generated from the website. The Web 3.0 is starting to be defined as the movement away from centralization of computation power in servers which provide services to clients (known as the \nclient-server network model\n) to peer-to-peer networks and blockchains, and \nfrom centralisation of authority and sovereignty from nation-states and corporations to the networked individual\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n refers to a a digital currency that secures transactions with cryptographic code, which is solved through hardware computational power (known as mining or proof of work) or other less energy-intensive ways such as proof-of-stake. (There are more details on that below.)\n\n\nZero knowledge proofs like\u00a0\nZK SNARKs\n can also be used to make cryptocurrency transactions more private \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u00a0or secret \ud83e\udd10\u00a0(which is different to being secure \ud83d\udd12), thus negating the need to run applications on a permissioned private network like the \nEthereum Enterprise Alliance\n. Ethereum uses \nprecompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128\n, for \npairing checks\n, which permit \nzk-SNARKs\n, also see \nhere\n, \nas implemented\n in the \nByzantium hard fork\n. There is also the Zerocoin protocol which is demonstrated by\u00a0\nZcoin\n\u00a0(which plans to integrate Ethereum).\n\n\nUses\n\n\nThe platform part of Ethereum makes it much more useful than just a cryptocurrency. With it, you can create any decentralized application (known as a dapp, which works over a peer-to- peer network rather than a centralized client-server network \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f), so the functionality is only limited by what programs could potentially do and not do, and by consequence, what programmers develop,\u00a0\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb but it can theoretically be used for any economic or governance activity.\n\n\nList of dapps\n\n\nFor a list of dapps, visit \nhere\n.\n\n\nMarket analysis\n\n\nAs of the 9th of January 2018, \nthe market capitalisation of Ethereum is $118.5 billion USD\n (refer to the link for the latest figure), and \nit has been in circulation possibly\u00a0since 30 July 2015\n, with the \nfirst transaction using Ethereum on 8 August 2015\n. Compare this with the next largest and the current largest cryptocurrency, \nBitcoin, with a market cap of $253.0 billion USD\n, where \nit has been in circulation since January 2009\n. Technically, Ethereum has had a much faster growth rate, while more importantly for long term investment (I do not encourage speculation as that only\u00a0causes volatility as has been seen)\u00a0the fundamentals are much better than Bitcoin. While it is true that Bitcoin has more of a market and currency, e.g. in terms of more entities that will accept it as a form of payment, the creator of this wiki expects that time will change that (indeed the \nmarket cap of Ethereum recently surpassed half that of Bitcoin, around May 2017\n). Also, \nthe number of transactions of Ethereum surpassed that of several cryptocurrencies combined on 22 Nov 2017\n. However, note \nthis retort\n.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nThere also several issues with Ethereum, such as not being scalable enough, not being full decentralized, energy consumption with mining and quantum computing attacks. With its \nlarge storage database\n (I have to provide a \nReddit link\n as a source as the \noriginal link\n doesn't have the graph any more, while \nWayback doesn't render it either\n), mining and architecture requiring to run a full node to mine or validate transactions, it is not decentralized enough. More (outdated but still applicable) info on that is e.g. \nhere\n, as well as \nhere\n.\n\n\nScalability\n\n\nEthereum will need to scale to process far more transactions per second (to become a \"\nworld computer\n\") than Visa, Mastercard and American Express combined (which process on the order of \ntens of thousands of transactions per second\n [in the link, CTRL+F 24,000]), while Ethereum 1.0, the current version as of December 30 2017, processed \na record of 1103523 transactions on Friday, December 22, 2017, or 12.77 transactions per second\n.\n\n\nNote that \nRipple claims that it's Consensus Ledger can process a thousand transactions per second\n, while it could process more with payment channels. \"Although payment channels achieve practically infinite scalability by decoupling payment from settlement, they do so without incurring the risk typically associated with delayed settlement.\" Further note that Ripple achieves this by trading off on decentralization, through a \ndistributed network of validators or distributed servers\n, while it has been described as a \nfederation protocol\n.\n\n\nThere are even more scalable blockchains that use a delegated proof of stake (DPOS) consensus protocol, such as Bitshares and Steem. \nBitshares can apparently process 100,000 TPS\n.\n\n\nMore generally, in order to have faster payments or higher transaction throughput, you need to reduce the number of validators (miners are a kind of validator that perform energy intensive computational work, finding a random nonce or sequence number in a large set of numbers) in the consensus protocol, or reduce the other (i.e. for faster payments you can reduce transaction throughput or reduce validators, while for higher transaction throughput you can reduce validators or have payments take longer to finalize). This is \na trade-off triangle\n. You could potentially have one blockchain with \nheterogeneous sharding\n, with different shards with a different degree of balance between these properties. Ethereum is working on \nsharding\n, which includes using \nstateless clients\n (while more on that is \nhere\n).\n\n\nIf you increase scalability in an instant via some blockchain or shard, while keeping latency constant (or reducing it) you need to reduce decentralization, which reduces the number of points of attack needed to compromise the whole network, i.e. reducing decentralization reduces security.\n\n\nProof of work / proof of stake / other proving methods\n\n\nThe mining process to crack cryptographic code (specifically to discover the nonce, a very large number, for each block by trial and error) requires a lot of computation power. Nevertheless, I'm guessing that the computation power should be less when you consider the \nenergy consumption\n of incumbent financial systems. (Think of extracting and processing resources to make coins and notes, minting and printing, energy consumption of banks and tiers of related energy consumption in the life cycle of fiat money.) Still, developers of some cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are transitioning to (as is the case for Ethereum), or already using, a different way of maintaining and creating blocks, known as proof of stake. For more information, you can see this Proof of Stake Wikipedia article \nhere\n\u00a0(although note the header warning about the article potentially not being verifiable or neutral due to relying heavily on sources too closely associated to the subject). The tricky part is in getting proof methods to work better than proof of work, as outlined \nhere\n\u00a0in the criticism section of the PoS Wiki.\n\n\nQuantum computing attacks\n\n\nIf quantum computing becomes more performant Ethereum's cryptographic signature scheme, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), would be insecure. However, there are solutions for this that will be implemented soon in the \nConstantinople release\n with \nEIP 86: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature, which has \"\nCustom cryptography\n: users can upgrade to ed25519 signatures, Lamport hash ladder signatures or whatever other scheme they want on their own terms; they do not need to stick with ECDSA.\" Lamport signatures could be used in a quantum resistant algorithm\n. More info on that is e.g. \nhere\n), \nhere\n, and \nhere\n.\n\n\nNo technological artefacts can be a panacea\n\n\nFor the continual improvement of humanity, there needs to be balance in life between things that benefit us materially and things that benefit us on higher levels, particularly spiritually. There is a risk that technology can make some people better off, and others worse off. So there needs to be consideration for how technology can be implemented to maximise \nutility\n.  One consideration of that is \nhere\n.\n\n\nBugs\n\n\nEthereum has had expensive bugs, such as \nthe DAO vulnerability (CTRL+F vulnerability)\n; and Parity multisig library contract issues \n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n. Also see \nreclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts\n, which gives more examples such as sending to an empty address,\ne.g. \n1\n and \n2\n. Info about another bug is \nhere\n.\n\n\nHow do you buy and sell Ether, the currency of Ethereum?\n\n\nRefer to \nhere\n.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nAre you interested in learning to develop smart contracts with Ethereum, and maybe develop a really useful dapp and become a millionaire?\n\n\nCheck out the \nEthereum website\n! Then, you can \nread the Solidity docs\n.\n\n\nIf you want to help contribute to core development, there is also:\n\n the \nYellow Paper\n (make sure that you read the \nEIPs\n too since as of Dec 8 it is not up-to-date with the last commit on August 8, while the Constantinople EIPs were implemented in October). Instead I recommend ;\n\n Learn Python first, e.g. with \nLearn Python the Hard Way\n (I learnt using this, it's pretty good), \nCodecademy\n, \nPydocs\n, \nCoursera\n, etc. Knowing Python is useful for \npyethereum\n, which is being used as an Ethereum client, to implement Serenity and sharding, as well as \nvyper\n, an experimental, secure smart contract programming language;\n\n \nLLL\n (also see \nhere\n and \nhere\n);\n\n \nJULIA\n, an intermediate language for different Ethereum virtual machines;\n\n clients such as \nGeth\n, \nParity\n which is under \nParity Tech\n a separate organization to the Ethereum Foundation, \nC++ Ethereum\n, \nPyethereum\n;\n\n \nSerenity\n;\n\n \nsharding\n;\n\n \nresearch\n such as stateless clients, sharding, scalability improvements, Casper and more;\n\n \nEWasM\n;\n\n if you're interested in testing, see the documentation \nhere\n, as well as \nthe Github tests repo\n, \na Gist here (it is outdated)\n,  and \nGitter here\n ; and\n* \nmany other repositories\n.\n\n\nConcluding remarks\n\n\nEther certainly seems like a good investment, and a good alternative to using fiat currencies, as well as an enabler for otherwise uneconomical business, due to lower transaction costs. It's more decentralized nature than central banks has advantages for trade from a local to global scale. With governance applications and systems on top Ethereum, it is even possible to do away with the hindering borders surmounted by nation-states. By doing away with these borders, society can be more open, inclusive and equitable.\n\n\nHowever, all technology can only help mankind and the world to a certain extent. What is more important is for each and every person to become increasingly blissful. Each person must go within and enter a stillness of body and mind, which is when that bliss starts to manifest, and practice balanced living. Practicing certain techniques such as those given by Self-Realization Fellowship, such as daily Kriya yoga meditation, developing unconditional love that starts in the heart, keeping the mind at the point between the eyebrows, and moral living, helps each person manifest that bliss within, and from there, express that bliss outwardly at all times.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\nAnother introduction\n\n\nMyEtherWallet knowledge base (good for issues with wallets)\n\n\nAn introduction (Frontier first release, outdated)\n\n\nHere's another introduction, made in November 2017\n\n\nEthereum community on Gitter\n\n\nEthereum research forum\n\n\nCorrect by construction Casper prototype\n\n\nCasper the Friendly Finality Gadget\n\n\nThe stateless client concept\n\n\nEthereum 2 and alternative PoS implementations\n\n\nEthereum wiki\n\n\nEthereum and the hodlers that love them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article was originally created here in May 2017, and has been regularly updated since then: https://sustergy.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/why-buy-ether-and-how/.

Note that  Ripple claims that it's Consensus Ledger can process a thousand transactions per second , while it could process more with payment channels. \"Although payment channels achieve practically infinite scalability by decoupling payment from settlement, they do so without incurring the risk typically associated with delayed settlement.\" Further note that Ripple achieves this by trading off on decentralization, through a  distributed network of validators or distributed servers , while it has been described as a  federation protocol .  There are even more scalable blockchains that use a delegated proof of stake (DPOS) consensus protocol, such as Bitshares and Steem.  Bitshares can apparently process 100,000 TPS .  More generally, in order to have faster payments or higher transaction throughput, you need to reduce the number of validators (miners are a kind of validator that perform energy intensive computational work, finding a random nonce or sequence number in a large set of numbers) in the consensus protocol, or reduce the other (i.e. for faster payments you can reduce transaction throughput or reduce validators, while for higher transaction throughput you can reduce validators or have payments take longer to finalize). This is  a trade-off triangle . You could potentially have one blockchain with  heterogeneous sharding , with different shards with a different degree of balance between these properties. Ethereum is working on  sharding , which includes using  stateless clients  (while more on that is  here ).  If you increase scalability in an instant via some blockchain or shard, while keeping latency constant (or reducing it) you need to reduce decentralization, which reduces the number of points of attack needed to compromise the whole network, i.e. reducing decentralization reduces security.",

Nevertheless, I'm guessing that the computation power should be less when you consider the  energy consumption  of incumbent financial systems. (Think of extracting and processing resources to make coins and notes, minting and printing, energy consumption of banks and tiers of related energy consumption in the life cycle of fiat money.) Still, developers of some cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are transitioning to (as is the case for Ethereum), or already using, a different way of maintaining and creating blocks, known as proof of stake. For more information, you can see this Proof of Stake Wikipedia article  here \u00a0(although note the header warning about the article potentially not being verifiable or neutral due to relying heavily on sources too closely associated to the subject). The tricky part is in getting proof methods to work better than proof of work, as outlined  here \u00a0in the criticism section of the PoS Wiki.",

By doing away with these borders, society can be more open, inclusive and equitable.  However, all technology can only help mankind and the world to a certain extent. What is more important is for each and every person to become increasingly blissful. Each person must go within and enter a stillness of body and mind, which is when that bliss starts to manifest, and practice balanced living. Practicing certain techniques such as those given by Self-Realization Fellowship, such as daily Kriya yoga meditation, developing unconditional love that starts in the heart, keeping the mind at the point between the eyebrows, and moral living, helps each person manifest that bliss within, and from there, express that bliss outwardly at all times.",

            "text": "Any good, service, governance or economic activity can be decentralized and tokenized with and transacted via Ethereum. The token represents the dapp (an abbreviation for decentralized app) while it uses the Ethereum blockchain, but the price of the token is different. Activity that has any economic or governance aspect, conceived or as of yet inconceived, can be done via Ethereum, provided that\u00a0the right code is written and the necessary hardware is used (such as computers running an Ethereum node, and in some special cases, a measurement device to measure a resource flow for additional verification/auditable purposes, like a meter for electricity \u26a1\ud83d\udd0c, water \ud83d\udeb0\u00a0or gas \ud83d\udd25; or a waste \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\u00a0volume detector).\n\n\nHere's a challenge: keep an eye out for activity that has not been implemented on Ethereum (or could be implemented in a better way; check this article and research to check whether it's implemented and if so, how well) and then:\n\n\n    \ndevelop a dapp for the idea yourself (after learning \nSolidity\n, if you don't already know it); or\n\n    \nsign an NDA with someone who is interested in developing dapps, share the idea, and form some agreement if they want to proceed with it (which could be proposed in the NDA itself), e.g. a founder's stake in an ICO, a salary, equity in the venture (although a community model more like Ethereum's non-profit foundation is better for a more equitable solution), royalties, a fee for every transaction, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe platform aspect of Ethereum has been referred to as a 'fat protocol' \nhere\n, as opposed to the 'thin protocols' of Web 1.0 and 2.0 with HTTP, SMTP, etc., with the take home point (in bold) being:\n\nthe market cap of the protocol always\n\u00a0\ngrows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top, since the success of the application layer drives further speculation at the protocol layer.\n\n\nOne kind of application that is particularly intriguing is decentralized autononous organisations (\nDAOs\n, this includes entities as large as, or even larger than nation-states\u00a0\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5, social networks, multinational public companies, etc.). Note that having complete autonomy is probably not a good idea, since code may not be able to handle new issues that arise, so human intervention should probably always be an option, but preferably in the hands of a small, non-profit entity or some decentralized solution (perhaps similar to the \nAragon Network\n). By analogy, you wouldn't want a nuclear power plant to be completely automated with no possible means of human intervention. As a precaution, you'd want several safeguards including, for example, an off button. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0As explained in this Ethereum Wiki \nhere\n, the first DAO, known as The DAO, resulted in many funds being stolen, and Ethereum hard forking into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\n\nThe following list is sourced from \nCoin Market Cap tokens (you can sort by market cap)\n and \nState of the Dapps\n, both of which lists many more, as well as elsewhere, e.g. Gitter research room chats. (There are 854 dapps on State of the Dapps as of Dec 1 2017; then [909 on Jan 1 2018] (https://web.archive.org/web/20180101114436/https://www.stateofthedapps.com/). \ud83d\ude2f You can search by tags.) Other examples are also presented e.g. on day 4 of \nDevcon 3\n, as well as outlined in the Ethereum whitepaper in the\u00a0\nintroduction\n\u00a0and \napplications section\n. Note also that while most of the dapps in the following list run on the Ethereum platform, some examples do not, and where they don't run on Ethereum, it is generally noted as what they do run on. This is not a big deal, as any dapp could theoretically run on another blockchain, (or indirectly via inter-blockchains like Cosmos or Polkadot) provided that the host blockchain has the required features. Also note that the below list is not an endorsement, and is not exhaustive or necessarily well-maintained. At worst, it's included because it was briefly looked into and it seemed like a good idea, while more time may have been spent doing due diligence on some ideas and can therefore have a better idea of its usefulness. Dapps that have been implemented, or are under development, or have been publicly conceptualised, includes:\n\n a stable coin, e.g. \nDai\n\n\n smart contracts for the legally enforceable and/or liquid transfer of assets, plus related services e.g. \nMattereum\n and \nSweetbridge\n, e.g. settlement, accounting, risk management, resource sharing, and Optimization \n Liquid Talent. Also, asset-based lending: secure loans with holding of assets e.g cryptocurrenices (locking them up) in exchange for cash (fiat currencies), such as Sweetbridge and \nSALT\n;\n\n \nVeritaseum\n, which \"enables software-driven P2P capital markets without brokerages, banks and traditional exchanges\".\n\n \ninvoice financing with Populous\n\n\n decentralized exchanges to buy and sell cryptos and fiat, e.g. \nlocalethereum\n; for cryptos only there is\u00a0\nDecentrex\n,\u00a0\nOmega One\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nNVO\n, where the latter two have not been launched as of November 30.\n\n non-decentralized exchanges such as \nCoinbase\n (US), \nBTCmarkets\n (Australia),  while more are below, or ones that only exchange cryptocurrencies like \nPoloniex\n;\n\n other exchanges like \nOmiseGo\n. \"OmiseGO is a public Ethereum-based financial technology for use in mainstream digital wallets, that enables real-time, peer-to-peer value exchange and payment services agnostically across jurisdictions and organizational silos, and across both fiat money and decentralized currencies. Designed to enable financial inclusion and disrupt existing institutions, access will be made available to everyone via the OmiseGO network and digital wallet framework.\";\n\n exchange platforms like \nBinance\n;\n\n asset exchanges like \nWAX\n.\n\n the \nBrave browser\n\u00a0(which the author uses) which uses the \nBasic Attention Token\n, which provides a better solution for users, publishers and advertisers;\n\n \nMaidSafe\n, which has another browser that actually runs on the \nOmni\n layer that runs on Bitcoin, not Ethereum. It is also claiming to be: \"The World's First Autonomous Data Network\". \nCurrently you have to receive an invite which requires roughly an hour of interaction on their Discourse forum/site.\n\n\n \nZeroNet\n, another decentralized internet network that runs on Bitcoin cryptography and the \nBitTorrent network\n. \nIt on Ubuntu 17.10\n. You can make \nyour own site\n, although \nyou may have issues with following a tutorial\n. Note that this link won't work unless you are running ZeroNet.sh) by clicking the download button on the homepage (then as detailed concisely below the button) extracting it and running (in bash) \n./ZeroNet.sh\n while \ncd\ned to the extracted folder that ZeroNet.sh is located in.\n\n storage, e.g. \nSwarm\n and a distributed hypermedia protocol, IPFS \nwebsite\n, \ndoc\n;\n\n communication protocols, e.g. \nWhisper\n\u00a0(also see\u00a0\nhere\n\u00a0for code), which allows dapps (you don't need to capitalize this since it is an abbreviation of decentralized applications) to communicate with each other;\n\n multi-chain networks/tools like \nPolkadot\n and \nBTCRelay\n\n\n \nEthereum Name Service\n (names like \njamesray.eth\n map to an address);\n\n \nmesh networking\n\u00a0e.g. implemented\u00a0\nhere\n and as voted for\u00a0\nhere\n\u00a0on Twitter (which also has other ideas posted in the comments);\n\n social networks e.g. \nAkasha\n\u00a0(news \nhere\n),\n\n \nStatus\n: \"A Mobile Ethereum OS: Browse, chat and make payments securely on the decentralized web.\";\n\n decentralized search engines, e.g. \nWeipoint\n\u00a0(a news post is\u00a0\nhere\n);\n\n reputation and ratings network e.g. as used by \nEtheal\n, which is described below (CTRL+F);\n\n identity (e.g. as provided by \nuPort\n, as well as \nin-blockchain proposal\n;\n* decentralized electricity trading and other decentralized energy economic applications,\u00a0which would allow renewable energy to be more economical and accelerate the transition to a clean, renewable energy and safe climate future.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of\n local electricity trading\n include: \nGrid+\n, \nLO3\n/\nTransactive Grid\n, \nPower Ledger\n, \nNexergy\n, \nLocal Volts\n\u00a0and \nDivvi\n. Grid+ uses Ethereum and \nthey have open source code\n. Power Ledger has closed source code and runs on the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, rather than the public Ethereum blockchain. \nThey had a token sale in early October\n.\u00a0Both Power Ledger and Grid+ also detail more unique applications in their pipeline, such as renewable energy asset generation (Power Ledger) and Grid+'s in-home computer, an \"intelligent agent\" that pays for a customers electricity in real-time, using stable tokens, stores cryptocurrency like the hardware wallet functions of Ledger and Trezor; providing Casper proof-of-stake signing, and provide an Ethereum API for IoT (\npp. 26 and 34-36, white paper\n). \nTransactive Grid uses Ethereum\n and it has been rolled out in \nBrooklyn with a microgrid\n, however LO3 hasn't released any code or details for its Transactive Grid application. The others are still all under development (as of August 2017), and they have been scant on the details of how they would implement their application, at the least not releasing their code. Divvi say on its website that they will use the blockchain. Local Volts and Nexergy do not.\n\n electricity tokenization: e.g.\u00a0\nSolarCoin\n, \nEnergyCoin\n, although both are altcoins rather than Ethereum tokens;\n\n governance of any organisation, e.g. \nDemocracy.Earth\n; and also\u00a0governance of DAOs, e.g. \nAragon\n;\n\n decentralized search engines like \nBitClave\n, \nWeipoint\n and \nEpocum\n;\n\n wallets like \nMyEtherWallet\n or hardware wallets \nTrezor\n or \nLedger\n;\n\n blockchain explorers like \nEtherscan\n;\n\n a gateway to decentralized services such as \nInfura\n;\n\n visit dapps in your browser with \nMetamask\n;\n\n decentralized media;\n\n asset titles (such as land titles). Read more on that \nhere\n: \"Having so far built the software and tested it with a couple dozen land title registrations, Bitfury and the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry have now signed a new memorandum of understanding to expand the service to purchases and sales of land titles, registration of new land titles, demolition of property, mortgages and rentals, as well as notary services\". Nottar.io also provides notary services. A similar, more specific application is for academic certificates with \nSmart Diploma\n;\n\n Debit card \ud83d\udcb3\u00a0transactions \ud83e\udd1d\u00a0(done on several exchanges \ud83d\udcb1, e.g. \nCoinjar Swipe\n (but it accepts BTC only), Coinbase, while others which I've mentioned elsewhere in this article have plans to do this e.g. \nOmiseGO\n;\n\n co-ownership of real assets e.g. the \nSwarm Fund\n\n\n crowdsales, e.g. an \nInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\n as compared with an \nIntial Public Offering (IPO)\n, or for tokens with Ethereum: an Initial Token Offering (ITO). Note that this is not so much a business model in itself, per se, rather it is more of a fundraising method (which has also led to scams, e.g. \nhere\n);\n\n crowd development (but not as part of the blockchain, e.g. \nhere\n), e.g. for infrastructure and other public assets;\n\n think of public companies being remodelled into communities with tokens instead of shares, governance using a platform like\u00a0\nDemocracy.Earth\n\u00a0(which can be tailored to have voting anywhere between one vote one person like direct democracy, or conventionally more hierarchical like a board of directors and token-holders instead of or in addition to\u2014and probably eventually superceding\u2014shareholders);\n\n dividend payouts and secure email-based transactions with \nDividend\n. For sending ETH via email there is also \nYou've Got ETH\n;\n\n prediction \ud83d\udd2e\u00a0\ud83e\udd89\u00a0markets like \nGNOSIS\n, \nAugur\n and \nWINGS DAO\n;\n\n \nBuilt-in price discovery and a liquidity mechanism for tokens with Bancor\n;\n\n labour/recruitment/freelance markets like \nChronobank\n and \nEthlance\n;\n\n permissioned distributed ledgers like \nHydrachain\n;\n\n trust-based models like the \nTrustlines Network\n\n\n Secure distributed computing, e.g.\u00a0\nGolem\n. Ethereum needs to be faster e.g. with \nEWASM\n and parallelizability.\n\n accountability, e.g. for \nnon-profits\n (e.g. \"how do I know how badly you need a donation unless I can see your net liabilities, net assets, and balance sheet, and how you plan to use the funds?\") and \naid\n\u00a0(also see\u00a0\nhere\n)\n\n Self Learning, Autonomous, Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (this could be used for many things such as self-driving cars, robots, or anything else that is owned by a contract; bots; and art);\n\n decentralised financial services like \nWeTrust\n;\n\n futures-like dapps such as \nTimeBank\n and \nhodlethereum\n;\n\n sharing car refueling stations with \nShare\nCharge\n;\n\n health, e.g. \nEtheal\n, a healthcare service comparison site with a content platform, trust and review / reputation system; an anonymous marketing platform for surveys, ads and communication research where users are paid by pharmaceutical companies; and a platform for building health apps;\n\n examples of contracts are \nhere\n and \nhere\n, e.g. voting, auctions (open or blind), safe remote purchases, micropayment channels, crowdfunding and company stock. Many more can be found on Github, which may be referenced from the whitepaper and the website of a dapp.\n* \ninsurance\n;\n\n\nExamples that have been conceptualized, but not implemented (at least as far as the creator of this wiki is aware of) include:\n\n reducing transaction costs for existing business models (\nhere\n is a good read about that). However, to tokenize online centric business models, the network model should change from client-server to peer-to-peer, to avoid a conflict of interest. This is more difficult to achieve since a server is a piece of infrastructure, and transferring to a peer-to-peer model would cause it to be a sunk cost. Additionally, it may be difficult to build a replacement dapp for a successful website, because it is hard to get a network of engaged users to change to using something else (inertia). Centralized web apps  (not just mobile apps but websites, and use the word to contrast with dapps) include:\n\n * Google (although note \nWeipoint\n as mentioned previously),\n\n * social networks like \nFacebook\n, Twitter,  (although note \nAkasha\n above);\n\n * online marketplaces e.g. Amazon, eBay and Alibaba (decentralized alternatives include \nSoma for products or services\n, \nCanya for services\n also note this simple implementation and subreddit \nhere\n, as well as more specific or niche marketplaces like \nCryptokitties\n, \nHamster\n). For more info see \nhere\n\n\n making economically viable other business models that have seen low uptake or aren't economically viable without blockchain tech. So-called sharing economy business models (which are more aptly called tasker or rentier capitalism models) like Airbnb, Uber, AirTasker, Fiverr, Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Menulog are particularly ripe for transformation (the term transformation is preferrable to disruption, since it should be a net positive change, while negative effects are manageable or solvable), since no trusted third party for a transaction is needed, such as banks \ud83c\udfe6, credit card \ud83d\udcb3\u00a0companies or PayPal, just a smart contract; and\n\n mortgage brokers;\n\n More examples are \nhere\n\u2014scroll to the examples\u2014they have bold headings and are about two thirds of the way down, or search for \"Dank meme\u00a0trading\". Note that the Basic Attention Token has already been mentioned, and the creator of this wiki is skeptical that AI will create truly beautiful art, since no AI can have any feeling. \nCryptoKitties\n is an example of meme trading and has taken up \na lot of the transactions on the Ethereum network\n.\n\n curation markets, which is part of what \nSteemit\n does (which runs on the STEEM network), and which curators, social networks and wiki authors would all benefit from. More info is \nhere\n;\n\n \nP2P Decentralised Autonomous Transportation Network\n\n\n \nWaste collection management\n. Other ideas include plus generally thinking of existing business models running on the blockchain, like real estate developers and investment trusts (with which blockchains could be used e.g. for crowdfunding).\n\n legally enforceable wills running on the blockchain, as well as being able to appoint an executor in a legally enforceable way on the blockchain.\n\n \nTron\n, \"a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to construct a worldwide free content entertainment system\"\n* \nOraclize\n, a blockchain oracle service;\n\n\nMore examples are e.g. \nhere in a blog post\n and \nhere on Wikipedia",
