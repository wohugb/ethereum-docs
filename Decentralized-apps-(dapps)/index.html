                  <h1>Uses / decentralized apps / dapps</h1>
                
                <p>Any good, service, governance or economic activity can be decentralized and tokenized with and transacted via Ethereum. The token represents the dapp (an abbreviation for decentralized app) while it uses the Ethereum blockchain, but the price of the token is different. Activity that has any economic or governance aspect, conceived or as of yet inconceived, can be done via Ethereum, provided that the right code is written and the necessary hardware is used (such as computers running an Ethereum node, and in some special cases, a measurement device to measure a resource flow for additional verification/auditable purposes, like a meter for electricity ⚡🔌, water 🚰 or gas 🔥; or a waste 🗑️ volume detector).</p>
<p>Here's a challenge: keep an eye out for activity that has not been implemented on Ethereum (or could be implemented in a better way; check this article and research to check whether it's implemented and if so, how well) and then:
<ul>
    <li>develop a dapp for the idea yourself (after learning <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity</a>, if you don't already know it); or</li>
    <li>sign an NDA with someone who is interested in developing dapps, share the idea, and form some agreement if they want to proceed with it (which could be proposed in the NDA itself), e.g. a founder's stake in an ICO, a salary, equity in the venture (although a community model more like Ethereum's non-profit foundation is better for a more equitable solution), royalties, a fee for every transaction, etc.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The platform aspect of Ethereum has been referred to as a 'fat protocol' <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, as opposed to the 'thin protocols' of Web 1.0 and 2.0 with HTTP, SMTP, etc., with the take home point (in bold) being:
<blockquote><strong>the market cap of the protocol always</strong> <strong>grows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top, since the success of the application layer drives further speculation at the protocol layer.</strong></blockquote></p>
<p>One kind of application that is particularly intriguing is decentralized autononous organisations (<strong>DAOs</strong>, this includes entities as large as, or even larger than nation-states 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇮🇳🇬🇧🇨🇳🇧🇷🇷🇺🇯🇵, social networks, multinational public companies, etc.). Note that having complete autonomy is probably not a good idea, since code may not be able to handle new issues that arise, so human intervention should probably always be an option, but preferably in the hands of a small, non-profit entity or some decentralized solution (perhaps similar to the <a href="https://aragon.one/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aragon Network</a>). By analogy, you wouldn't want a nuclear power plant to be completely automated with no possible means of human intervention. As a precaution, you'd want several safeguards including, for example, an off button. 😉 As explained in this Ethereum Wiki <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, the first DAO, known as The DAO, resulted in many funds being stolen, and Ethereum hard forking into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p>The following list is sourced from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/">Coin Market Cap tokens (you can sort by market cap)</a> and <a href="https://dapps.ethercasts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Dapps</a>, both of which lists many more, as well as elsewhere, e.g. Gitter research room chats. (There are 854 dapps on State of the Dapps as of Dec 1 2017; then [909 on Jan 1 2018] (https://web.archive.org/web/20180101114436/https://www.stateofthedapps.com/). 😯 You can search by tags.) Other examples are also presented e.g. on day 4 of <a href="http://www.ryanyosua.me/devcon-3-talks/">Devcon 3</a>, as well as outlined in the Ethereum whitepaper in the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#a-next-generation-smart-contract-and-decentralized-application-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applications section</a>. Note also that while most of the dapps in the following list run on the Ethereum platform, some examples do not, and where they don't run on Ethereum, it is generally noted as what they do run on. This is not a big deal, as any dapp could theoretically run on another blockchain, (or indirectly via inter-blockchains like Cosmos or Polkadot) provided that the host blockchain has the required features. Also note that the below list is not an endorsement, and is not exhaustive or necessarily well-maintained. At worst, it's included because it was briefly looked into and it seemed like a good idea, while more time may have been spent doing due diligence on some ideas and can therefore have a better idea of its usefulness. Dapps that have been implemented, or are under development, or have been publicly conceptualised, includes:
<em> a stable coin, e.g. <a href="https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/DaiDec17WP.pdf">Dai</a>
</em> smart contracts for the legally enforceable and/or liquid transfer of assets, plus related services e.g. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> and <a href="https://sweetbridge.com">Sweetbridge</a>, e.g. settlement, accounting, risk management, resource sharing, and Optimization &amp; Liquid Talent. Also, asset-based lending: secure loans with holding of assets e.g cryptocurrenices (locking them up) in exchange for cash (fiat currencies), such as Sweetbridge and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/salt/">SALT</a>;
<em> <a href="http://veritas.veritaseum.com/">Veritaseum</a>, which "enables software-driven P2P capital markets without brokerages, banks and traditional exchanges".
</em> <a href="https://populous.co/">invoice financing with Populous</a>
<em> decentralized exchanges to buy and sell cryptos and fiat, e.g. <a href="https://localethereum.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">localethereum</a>; for cryptos only there is <a href="https://decentrex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentrex</a>, <a href="https://omega.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omega One</a> and <a href="http://nvo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVO</a>, where the latter two have not been launched as of November 30.
</em> non-decentralized exchanges such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> (US), <a href="https://btcmarkets.net/">BTCmarkets</a> (Australia),  while more are below, or ones that only exchange cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.poloniex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poloniex</a>;

<em> reducing transaction costs for existing business models (<a href="https://bravenewcoin.com/news/tokenize-the-enterprise-and-melt-it-into-the-community-rinse-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> is a good read about that). However, to tokenize online centric business models, the network model should change from client-server to peer-to-peer, to avoid a conflict of interest. This is more difficult to achieve since a server is a piece of infrastructure, and transferring to a peer-to-peer model would cause it to be a sunk cost. Additionally, it may be difficult to build a replacement dapp for a successful website, because it is hard to get a network of engaged users to change to using something else (inertia). Centralized web apps  (not just mobile apps but websites, and use the word to contrast with dapps) include:

<em> making economically viable other business models that have seen low uptake or aren't economically viable without blockchain tech. So-called sharing economy business models (which are more aptly called tasker or rentier capitalism models) like Airbnb, Uber, AirTasker, Fiverr, Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Menulog are particularly ripe for transformation (the term transformation is preferrable to disruption, since it should be a net positive change, while negative effects are manageable or solvable), since no trusted third party for a transaction is needed, such as banks 🏦, credit card 💳 companies or PayPal, just a smart contract; and
