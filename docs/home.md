# 以太坊文档

This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by the Ethereum Foundation, including **Ethereum**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, as well as sister protocols like **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_, and Swarm.

## 入门

To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit the Ethereum homepage over at [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). For another introduction targeted for end-users but also for (aspiring) developers and others, see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction.md). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](http://paper.gavwood.com/). If you are interested in developing smart contracts you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Programming_languages), as well as under dapp development in the sidebar.

## 不要迷路

Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki), [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) and [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon).
